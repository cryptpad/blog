This month was the annual XWiki seminar where most of our team got to meet IRL in Romania for a week. This shifted some of our usual deadlines such as the publication of this post and the Autumn Release (2025.9.0), basically everything is a couple of weeks late so thank you for bearing with us!

## ðŸŒ² Seminar and hackathon

Each year a fixture of the seminar is a day of Hackathon where the team gets to work on wildcard projects, experiments, or prototypes. This year we have a great selection!

### Webxdc CryptPad

The team produced a prototype for using the [Webxdc](https://webxdc.org/) API within CryptPad. This simple file format for applications is designed to be lightweight and take advantage of the offline-first and end-to-end encrytpion capabilities of the platform hosting it (for example a messenger such as [Delta Chat](https://delta.chat)).

The team managed to port and integrate [a simple chess game](https://github.com/ArcaneCircle/chess) into CryptPad.

### CryptPad CLI

XWiki CEO Ludovic Dubost experimented with a command-line client for CryptPad. He managed to connect a CryptPad account and browse the drive using commands like `cd` and `ls`.

### Cristal in CryptPad

XWikier Pierre Jeanjean experimented with an integration of the new XWiki user-interface [Cristal](https://cristal.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/WebHome) as a CryptPad application. This leveraged both Cristal's wiki support capabilities and CryptPad's secure sharing and file support. This PoC integration offers the capability to create and manage a shareable encrypted wiki, that can contain any pad type supported by the CryptPad instance by embedding the corresponding editor.

## ðŸ“¹ ParisJug Tools in Action Video

Fabrice & Ludovic presented CryptPad to the Paris Java Users Group, 9 years after the initial demo. They talked about what changed in the project's first decade, and demonstrated the clientside API. [The video of the presentation](https://peertube.xwiki.com/w/tKLzwGvUtXFrHD7HukYAWA) is now available (in French).
