## ðŸš€ 2025.3.1 with OnlyOffice 8

This month we released [CryptPad 2025.3.1](https://github.com/cryptpad/cryptpad/releases/tag/2025.3.1) with the much anticipated upgrade to OnlyOffice 8.3 for the Document, Spreadsheet, and Presentation applications. The upgrade includes improved support for right-to-left languages, a more compact user-interface, and many more features and improvements since the last version ([7.1](https://blog.cryptpad.org/2023/05/03/status-2023-04/))


## ðŸ“° CryptPad in use and in the news

### Bearstech

We are happy to see French open-source cooperative Bearstech [echo CryptPad news](https://mamot.fr/@bearstech/114512086526972934). Their software recommendations are widely followed and always great so we are in good company in their ["Open-Source watch" bulletin](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/la-veille-des-ours-n61-bearstech-ifirf/) (in French).

### Tutaâ€™s de-google list

We have a lot of appreciation for Tuta's work on privacy-respecting email. We were very glad to notice CryptPad in [their list of recommendations for Google alternatives](https://tuta.com/blog/how-to-leave-google-gmail).

### DÃ©sarmer BollorÃ©

Another one from France, we were happy to see [a campaign to fight back against far-right billionaire influence on school manuals](https://desarmerbollore.net/news/ne-laissons-pas-Bollore-envahir-les-manuels-scolaires-et-les-cerveaux-de-nos-enfants#les-50-premi%C3%A8res-signataires) use CryptPad forms to gather signatures (in French).

## ðŸ”­ Next up

- We are working towards the summer release (2025.6.0) due at the end of the month!
