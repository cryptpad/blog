## 🍁 Autumn release (2025.9.0)

This quarter's release was delayed by a couple weeks due to the annual seminar that took place late September. We needed the extra time to test as this release comes with a major update that touches nearly every part of CryptPad: icons! 

We finally let go of Fontawesome 4.7 (released in 2016) and our hacky custom web-font CP Tools, in favour of [our new fork](https://github.com/cryptpad/icons) of [Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev/) that includes applications icons and other customizations.

The work to replace the icons was substantial as they are used in almost every part of the CryptPad interface. We implemented this upgrade in a way that makes any future change much easier, as only one file would need to be edited.

The release also includes a simplified loading screen. This is the first point of contact with CryptPad for a lot of people, for example when being sent a link to a shared document. We updated this screen to feel more simple and polished, while clearly stating that the platform is end-to-end encrypted. 

Please see the [release notes](https://github.com/cryptpad/cryptpad/releases/tag/2025.9.0) for a full list of fixes and improvements in the release.


## 📰 CryptPad in use

### Huminfra conference

We spotted that researcher Elizabeth Ashley Fox-Jensen [mentions CryptPad](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/elizabethashleyfox_glad-to-share-that-i-will-be-presenting-activity-7389705367116464128-RF4s/) in the upcoming paper: "Beyond Big Tech Dependencies: Building Collaborative and Accessible Digital Tools for Participatory Art Historical Research" that will be part of the [Huminfra HiC 25 conference](https://www.huminfra.se/HiC-2025). We hope to catch the proceedings!


### Tactiques, Le Monde

Le Monde journalists are once again using CryptPad to list their sources, this time for a [video documentary about the militarized D9 Bulldozer used in the Gaza strip](https://www.lemonde.fr/videos/video/2025/10/16/gaza-le-d9-israelien-un-bulldozer-de-guerre-au-service-de-l-aneantissement-de-l-enclave_6647187_1669088.html).


## 🔭 Next up

- Between the delay in the last release and the holiday season coming up the team is left with a shorter release-cycle than usual. Everyone is still hard at work though, as we figure out what we can achieve in the time we have:
  - OnlyOffice work is still progressing so we may see a version upgrade (to be confirmed)
  - We have discovered a new mode in the Diagram app which is promising
  - We will continue to improve the look and feel of CryptPad, this time looking at the Drive
