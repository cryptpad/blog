With the yearly budget update taking the spotlight last month, this is our first real status update of 2025. We have an announcement that we have been wanting to make for a very long time:

## Document and Presentation are now open to everyone on CryptPad.fr

When we first introduced the Document and Presentation OnlyOffice applications in [October 2021](https://blog.cryptpad.org/2021/10/21/Announcing-new-apps/) we opted for an "early-access" release in order to test their stability. The applications were available to anyone self-hosting CryptPad, but had to be explicitly enabled. On CryptPad.fr we displayed a caution warning to users and limited the creation of new Documents and Presentations to subscribers. Our aim was to limit the influx of reports to our support team, which did not exist at the time. While the applications were workable, we regularly received reports of corrupted documents, especially in collaborative settings, and we were not able to reliably reproduce errors. We stayed in this limbo for a few years, not really reaching a state stable enough to change the status quo. 

At the end of 2024, thanks to the tireless work of Wolfgang Ginolas on our team, we finally broke through and dramatically improved the stability of Document and Presentation in our [last release](https://github.com/cryptpad/cryptpad/releases/tag/2024.12.0). Since then we have been monitoring the situation closely and we are now confident enough to open the Document and Presentation applications to all users on CryptPad.fr ! 

We have already soft-launched this for nearly a month so we encourage everyone to try the applications. We're working on a number of [issues and features](https://github.com/cryptpad/cryptpad/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3AOnlyOffice), and known problems with document conversion when using Safari. We are working to upgrade to version 8 of OnlyOffice in the upcoming CryptPad Spring release planned for the end of the month.

## Privacy guides article

We were delighted to read the in-depth [review of CryptPad on Privacy Guides](https://www.privacyguides.org/articles/2025/02/07/cryptpad-review/) by staff writer [Em](https://www.privacyguides.org/articles/author/em/). This very accessible and thorough guide is a really great introduction to CryptPad. The articles makes the case for switching, covering all of the practical information and unique quirks that come with end-to-end encryption.

## üßë‚Äçüî¨ Iulian joins the team as an intern

We are happy to welcome Iulian, who is joining the team for the next six months to prototype post-quantum cryptography in CryptPad. This should improve the security of CryptPad against future threats.

## üì∫ FOSDEM Talks Videos

The videos from our FOSDEM talks are now online

- Fabrice Mouhartem [CryptPad: Recent Advances in Privacy and Collaboration](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-5033-cryptpad-recent-advances-in-privacy-and-collaboration/)
- Ludovic Dubost [20 Years of Hacking the Funding of XWiki and CryptPad](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-4601-20-years-of-hacking-the-funding-of-xwiki-and-cryptpad/)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Appeal to admins of notes.dunst.be

Unfortunately the ComputerLiebe CryptPad instance, which used to be listed on https://cryptpad.org/instances/, has been unresponsive for a few weeks. Affected users have contacted us wondering how they can recover their data. We have tried to contact the administrators through the email we have, with no success.

We therefore ask our community: if anyone knows the admins of https://notes.dunst.be/ please help us get in touch with them and/or urge them directly to rectify this situation. Please boost our [mastodon post](https://fosstodon.org/@cryptpad/114080910894052799) if you can to help give this visibility.


##  üî≠ Next up

The team is hard at work on the Spring release (2025.3.0) planned for the end of March, more on this in the next status!
