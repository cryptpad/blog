## 🌻 Summer Release (2025.6.0)

![screenshot of the badge feature showing some guest users, a user called Problem and another called "here to help" wtih a support badge](/images/badges-demo.png)

We have just deployed the latest version of CryptPad to our [flagship instance](https://cryptpad.fr/). This version includes:

🏅 New badges to identify instance administrators and moderation/support accounts. Subscribers on CryptPad.fr also have a new badge if they want to show their support. Badges are opt-in, enabled in the new Profile section in user settings.

🕰️ Improvements to Diagram history and export

♿ 📱 Many more improvements to accessibility and mobile usage

Please see the full list on GitHub, if all goes well we will tag the Summer Release there within the next week.


## 🏆 OW2 Community Award

We attended [OW2con 25](https://www.ow2con.org/view/2025/) earlier this month and were honored to receive the [OW2 Community Award](https://www.ow2con.org/view/2025/Awards_Results).

## 📱🔒 Murena vault

Murena, a French de-googled mobile company that develops open-source /e/ OS, has integrated CryptPad in their latest release. The new [Murena Vault](https://doc.e.foundation/murena-vault) service for subscribers is based on a customized CryptPad instance. We're happy to see CryptPad deployed in this new setting and to be [mentioned in Murena's press coverage](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-replaced-my-ipad-with-a-de-googled-android-tablet-for-a-week-heres-my-buying-advice/). We'll need to join forces if we are to propose viable alternatives to Big Tech.
