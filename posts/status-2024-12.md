At the end of December the team was hard at work on the latest release, then most took well-deserved breaks for the holiday season. This brings us to this slighthly delayed final status update for 2024, with our very best wishes for 2025!

## üöÄ ‚ùÑÔ∏è Winter release (2024.12.0)

We wrapped up our [Winter release](https://github.com/cryptpad/cryptpad/releases/tag/2024.12.0) before the end of the year. This version delivers fixes and improvements across CryptPad. We were particularly happy to release a fix of our OnlyOffice integration that could address long-standing issues with documents becoming corrupted. If confirmed at scale, this fix could dramatically improve the use of OnlyOffice apps in CryptPad. Please see the [changelog](https://github.com/cryptpad/cryptpad/releases/tag/2024.12.0) for full details.


## ‚òÅÔ∏è CryptPad Cloud demo instances

We are happy to announce that you can now test-drive your very own CryptPad instance using our [Cloud demo service](https://cryptpad.org/try-cloud/). This service builds on [a similar one](https://xwiki.com/en/try-xwiki/) by our parent company XWiki. You can launch demo instances after filling out some basic information, confirm your email to extend the demo to a few days, and finally [subscribe](https://cryptpad.org/pricing/#full) if you are happy with the product.

We hope this will encourage bigger actors such as companies and organizations to consider having their own instance managed by us. This is one of the avenues we are exploring to make the project more financially sustainable.


## üéôÔ∏è CryptPad at FOSDEM 2025

Our very own Fabrice Mouhartem will represent CryptPad at [FOSDEM 2025](https://fosdem.org/2025/) with an overview of the progress made in the last year: "accessibility and mobile, performance improvements, cloud instances, and work on the OnlyOffice integration to name a few".

You can catch his talk on [Saturday Feb. 1st at 12:15 in H.1308](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-5033-cryptpad-recent-advances-in-privacy-and-collaboration/).


## üî≠ Next up

- We're preparing our yearly budget report which we'll publish in the next few weeks
- We are starting work on the üíê Spring release (2025.3.0) planned for end March 2025. We aim to upgrade OnlyOffice to version 8 among other improvements
- We are looking forward to welcome an intern in the spring to work on cryptography improvements, more about this in due course
