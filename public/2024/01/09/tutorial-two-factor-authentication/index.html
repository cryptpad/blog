        <p>In this tutorial we will see how to set up two-factor authentication (or 2FA) in
CryptPad from an end-user point of view. To make a long story short you can look
at <a href="https://docs.cryptpad.org/en/user_guide/user_account.html#security-privacy">the documentation</a> for the concise explanation.</p>
<p>The main purpose of this tutorial is to accompany you through every step and to
help you understand what is going on behind the scene.</p>
<h2>Why does it matter?</h2>
<p>Multi-factor authentication is a general term to describe authentication methods
relying on the combination of multiple ways to confirm you identity. Ideally,
these should live in different domains:</p>
<ul>
<li>Something I know: a knowledge that only the authenticating user is aware
of, traditionally a password or a passphrase, but secret questions also fells
into this category;</li>
<li>Something I have: a form of data that the user can store, but doesn't
have to remember. It is usually a cryptographic key that is stored in a device
(an authentication device, your smartphone, a USB flash drive, and so on);</li>
<li>Something I am: everything that is inherent to the identity of the user,
such as biometry for instance.</li>
</ul>
<p>The purpose of multi-factor authentication is to strengthen the usual
username-password authentication method (which fells into the &quot;something I know&quot;
category), so it does not act as a single-point of failure. With multi-factor
authentication, even if your password leaks by any means, no one should be able
to impersonate you based on this information alone. Similarly, biometric data
inherent to users should not be used as a unique authentication factor as their
secrecy cannot be guaranteed.</p>
<p><a href="/2023/08/18/status-2023-summer-02/">CryptPad 5.4.0</a> introduced 2FA using a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_one-time_password">time-based
one-time-password</a>
(or TOTP) approach. The core idea is that upon initialization, a common
<strong>secret</strong> is agreed on between CryptPad and the user. Then, the <strong>current
time</strong> is used to agree on a common value based on these two pieces of
information.</p>
<p>As a consequence, if you are managing your own CryptPad instance, you
have to make sure that the date and time of your server remain fairly accurate
(up to a 30 seconds shift), using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol">NTP</a> for instance.</p>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
<li>A running CryptPad instance with version <code>&gt;= 5.4.0</code>;</li>
<li>A CryptPad account on this instance (or you can <a href="https://docs.cryptpad.org/en/user_guide/user_account.html">create
one</a> now)</li>
<li>An external device that supports TOTP (for instance a smartphone with an
authenticator application, like <a href="https://getaegis.app/">Aegis</a>, that can be
found on <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.beemdevelopment.aegis/">F-Droid</a>
or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.beemdevelopment.aegis">Google Play
Store</a>).
It will later be referred as <em>authentication device</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Step-by-step user guide to setup 2FA on Cryptpad</h2>
<p>Now that we have everything we need, let us start. The first step is to
open your Security &amp; Privacy settings:<br>
<strong>User menu</strong> (top-right avatar to access) &gt; <i class="fa fa-gear"></i>
<strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <i class="fa fa-lock"></i> <strong>Security &amp; Privacy</strong></p>
<p>Then look for the “<strong>Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</strong>” section:</p>
<p><img src="/images/2fa-initialization.png" alt="2FA is not initialized yet"></p>
<p>Now, you can enter your password to initiate the process. Once you validate, it
should show an alert telling you to store a recovery code that will be useful to
disable 2FA in case you don't have access to your authentication device anymore.
Thus, you should store it in a safe place:</p>
<ul>
<li>recoverable even if you lose your authentication device;</li>
<li>accessible even if you don't have access to your CryptPad account;</li>
<li>separated from your password;</li>
<li>not easily accessible for a third party.</li>
</ul>
<p>These make your mobile phone or a “Recovery Code” file in your CryptDrive a bad
idea. However, you can use an encrypted USB flash drive or a <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/en/what-you-should-know-about-our-standard-digital-safe-boxes">digital safe
box/vault</a> for instance.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2fa-recovery-code.png" alt="2FA recovery code"></p>
<p>Once you stored this recovery code in a safe place, you can click on the “<i
class="fa fa-check"></i> <strong>Done</strong>” button, then “<strong>Continue</strong>”.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2fa-recovery-code-done.png" alt="2FA recovery code done"></p>
<p>Then, it should show you a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code">QR code</a> that
contains the common secret between CryptPad and yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Warning.</strong> This is sensitive information, make sure that no one is spying on
your screen at this point of time.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2fa-qr-code.png" alt="QR Code"></p>
<p>You can now scan the QR code with your authentication device, for instance Aegis
on android would open the form shown hereunder upon scanning the QR Code,
allowing you to customize the entry in the application. It could prove useful if
you have many CryptPad accounts for instance to distinguish them in a glance.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2fa-aegis-create.png" alt="Aegis scanner" width="50%"></p>
<p>Once validated, your CryptPad 2FA verification token would appear as an item in a
list in the application, with a progress bar telling you how long the shown
verification code remains valid.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2fa-aegis-show.png" alt="Aegis scanner" width="50%"></p>
<p>Now, it leaves you to enter this verification code in the CryptPad webpage and
validate with the “<i class="fa fa-check"></i> <strong>ENABLE 2FA</strong>” button.</p>
<p>One this is done, you should see the following text:</p>
<p><img src="/images/2fa-activated.png" alt="2FA is active on this account"></p>
<p>Congratulations! Your account is now set up to use 2FA using with TOTP.</p>
<p>Note that you will be disconnected for all your other sessions once it's done,
you have to log in again in these sessions with your verification code.</p>
<p>This is done as usual, with the difference that after typing your login and
password, a validation code from your authentication device will be requested.</p>
<h2>More information</h2>
<h3>Disabling 2FA</h3>
<p>When <strong>disabling 2FA</strong>, you need a final verification code, so don't
remove it from your authentication device <em>before</em> removing it from CryptPad.
Otherwise, you would need to retrieve your recovery code from its safe space. Or
in a last resort, see the “I lost my recovery code!” section below to see how to
use human intervention by contacting your instance administrators.</p>
<h3>What is this text box above the QR Code?</h3>
<p>Upon generating the shared secret between you and the server, that is given to
you in the form of a QR Code, you can also notice that there is a text box above
the QR code that contains a <em>uniform resource identifier</em> (URI for short). This
<a href="https://github.com/google/google-authenticator/wiki/Key-Uri-Format">otpauth
URI</a>
represents the secret in a plaintext manner and allows to easily import it into
applications that don't rely on a QR code scanner, for instance a password
manager.</p>
<p>As we said previously, it is not recommended to store your password and your
2FA secret in the same place, as it makes your password manager a single-point
of failure.</p>
<h2>I lost my recovery code!</h2>
<h3>User guide</h3>
<p>Good thing you use an encrypted flash drive to store your recovery code, however
its data <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory#Limitations">got corrupted</a>
on the way. What to do now?</p>
<p>Stay calm, it is possible for an administrator to disable 2FA for you provided
that you send the relevant information.</p>
<p>For that when logging in, after typing your username and password, there is a link under the verification code prompt:</p>
<p><img src="/images/2fa-recovery-request.png" alt="Unable to get a code? Recover your account"></p>
<p>You can then click on the “<strong>Recover your account</strong>” link, that will ask your
username and password again. Once that done, you end up in the page asking for
your recovery code, however there is also a section to unfold “<i class="fa
fa-caret-right"></i> <strong>Forgot recovery code</strong>” which shows a data-block that
you can give to an instance administrator so that they can disable 2FA for your account.</p>
<p>Now, you can contact your instance administrator, politely explaining the
situation and attaching this data block, and patiently wait for their answer.</p>
<h3>Administrator guide</h3>
<p>As an instance administrator, upon receiving a request to disable 2FA and
verifying the identity of the requesting party, you have to go to the database
section of the administration panel:
<strong>User menu</strong> &gt; <i class="fa fa-gears"></i> <strong>Administration</strong> &gt; <i class="fa fa-database"></i> <strong>Database</strong></p>
<p>There you can go to the <strong>2FA Recovery</strong> section and paste the data-block that
the forgetful user sent you:</p>
<p><img src="/images/2fa-admin-disabling.png" alt="Disabling 2FA for admins"></p>
<p>Then you just have to hit the “<strong>DISABLE</strong>” button and the “<strong>Are you sure?</strong>”
confirmation to validate the user's query.</p>
<h2>Good practices</h2>
<p>Activating and using 2FA in itself doesn't guarantee that your account would
remain safe whatever what happens, it is just another safety net.</p>
<p>However, to ensure that it works as intended, there are some mistakes to avoid.
For instance, some password managers can act as a storage for your 2FA secrets
and even generate the verification codes for you. In the event that your
password is also stored there, then you create a new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LastPass#2022_customer_data_and_partially-encrypted_vault_theft">single-point of
failure</a>
in your password manager. For the sake of honesty, we should mention that is it
still way better than not having any 2FA at all (as it adds a temporal factor in
what your password manager outputs in case of phishing attacks for instance). It
should be avoided in an ideal world, but we are not living in this world.</p>
<p>In general, you should avoid at all cost storing your passwords, secret keys and
recovery keys in a place where it is easily accessible (for instance in a
<code>my_passwords.csv</code> file in the clear on your drive, or in a plaintext cloud
storage).
The use of a password manager makes it easier for users to manage this part as
long as one sets up the appropriate measures to keep it secure, for instance
with the use of a strong primary password, or not leaving your <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/password-manager-remember-delete-edit-logins#w_protecting-your-passwords">computer
unattended in an unlocked
state</a>.</p>
