<p>A <a href="https://blog.cryptpad.org/2024/03/18/Pour-un-usage-securise-de-CryptPad/">French translated version</a> is also available.</p>
<p>You're looking for a privacy-focused collaboration tool?
Well, you already found it!
But what does “privacy” in this context actually mean?
And how is it technically enforced?
Are there any additional precautions needed for an extra-safe usage of CryptPad?</p>
<p>In this blog post we will answer these and other questions.
We will show you in which scenarios CryptPad is secure, and give you ideas for
concrete actions for using CryptPad safely.
While we do as much as possible to make CryptPad secure, its security also
depends on how you use it.</p>
<h2>🧑‍🏫 Preliminaries</h2>
<h3>🗺 Threat model</h3>
<p>When speaking of security or privacy, we should always define the scenario we
are speaking of.
This scenario is the so-called <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/glossary/threat-model"><em>threat
model</em></a> which defines the
<a href="https://ssd.eff.org/glossary/capability">adversarial capabilities</a>.
In general, we aim to think of them to be as powerful as possible.
If we can defend against a strong
<a href="https://ssd.eff.org/glossary/adversary">adversary</a>,
we can also defend against a weaker one.</p>
<p>The first assumption about the adversarial capabilities follows directly from
CryptPad's architecture.
CryptPad is a web application: you visit the website of your
<a href="https://docs.cryptpad.org/en/user_guide/instances.html">instance</a> (e.g.,
<a href="https://cryptpad.fr">https://cryptpad.fr</a>) and automatically download the client code that will be
executed locally on your computer.
If you receive bogus code from this server, you cannot establish any security,
as this bogus code may, as an example, send all your documents in plaintext to
the server.
Hence, you must trust the server to not run any <em>active</em>
<a href="https://ssd.eff.org/glossary/attack">attacks</a> (i.e., not to run
a modified CryptPad server software).</p>
<p>We nevertheless defend against an <em>honest-but-curious</em> (i.e., passive) server.
The second assumption is thus that the server plays according to the rules, but
could try to infer sensitive information by analyzing all the data it receives.
This scenario includes the possibility that a third-party gets access to the
server and can see all data and logs.
CryptPad has already defended against such an adversary in the past when <a href="https://newsrnd.com/tech/2022-06-24-data-confiscated-from-pirate-party-servers.SJxeH5I79q.html">a
third-party instance was seized by the
police</a>.
We therefore consider this scenario to be highly realistic.</p>
<p>Lastly, we assume the attackers to have network capability.
This would be the case for the system administrator managing the network
in your office, your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_service_provider">internet service
provider</a>, or secret
services as well as many others.
The attackers may even use active network capabilities, that is they can sniff
your web traffic, and also replay, drop or modify data sent over the network.</p>
<!-- ### 🔎 Security and Privacy -->
<!-- The notions of _security_ and _privacy_ are often mixed, however they do not -->
<!-- refer to the same concept. -->
<!-- In the context of CryptPad, the two notions can be differentiated as follows: -->
<!-- * **Security:** An adversary cannot read or modify your documents, your -->
<!--   messages, or the teams your belonging to. -->
<!-- * **Privacy:** An adversary cannot link your activity to other profiles, your -->
<!--   name or to any of your sensitive data. -->
<!-- CryptPad aims to give you both. -->
<!-- However, as any other website you're visiting, the server can see your -->
<!-- [IP address](https://ssd.eff.org/glossary/ip-address) and your ["user -->
<!-- agent"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent) -->
<!-- (browser and [operating system](https://ssd.eff.org/glossary/operating-system)). -->
<h3>🔑 Cryptography</h3>
<p>One of the key features of CryptPad is <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/glossary/end-to-end-encryption">end-to-end
encryption</a>. Let us give you
a rough idea of what encryption and authentication are. There are three main
building blocks:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Symmetric Encryption</strong> (or secret key encryption) works similar to a box
with a lock: We can put something into the box and lock the box by key
(encryption).
Only someone with the key can unlock the box and access the content
(decryption) and modify it.
Since the same key is used to lock and unlock the box, this scheme is dubbed
<em>symmetric</em>.
We can further make copies of the key and distribute it to people whom we
trust, so that they can all lock and unlock the box.</li>
<li><strong>Asymmetric Encryption</strong> (or public key encryption: PKE for short) differs
from symmetric encryption in that a different key is used for encryption
(namely, the <em>public key</em>) and decryption (the <em>private key</em>).
You can imagine asymmetric encryption as the following system: you distribute
open locks (the public encryption key) to everyone and keep the (secret
decryption) key to yourself. Then, if someone wants to send you a message,
they put it in a box and close a lock on it.
Thus, only you can open it while anyone can produce a locked box for you.<p><img alt="Box with a lock" src="/images/unsplash-lock_on_a_box.jpg" /></p>
</li>
<li><strong>Digital Signatures</strong> are closely related to physical seals: Only the
persons in possession of the seal (which we call the <em>signing key</em>) can sign,
but all other people can verify the authenticity of a document using the
public <em>verification key</em> of the emitter.
In addition, digital signatures also guarantee that no one is able to modify
the sealed content without readers noticing it. A property that regular
seals don’t enjoy.<br>
Note that there is a symmetric variant of this primitive called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_authentication_code"><em>message
authentication
code</em></a>. However,
it is rarely used as an independent building block and is jointly used with
symmetric encryption to achieve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authenticated_encryption">authenticated
encryption</a>, that
further guarantees that messages are not tampered. As we exclusively use
authenticated encryption in CryptPad, we usually use “symmetric encryption”
instead in the explanations for simplicity, but actual guarantees are
stronger.<p><img alt="Physical seal" src="/images/unsplash-sealed_letter.jpg" /></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For CryptPad, we combine all of these building blocks to achieve different
goals. We will explain the usage below in the section pertaining to Documents.</p>
<h2>🧗 The Basics</h2>
<p>We outline some basic measurements that allow you to significantly increase the
security of your CryptPad usage:</p>
<!-- ensure that you are using an instance that is up-to-date
  ie. compare against https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad
  https://cryptpad.org/instances/ only lists third-party hosts that
  have updated in a reasonable amount of time
-->
<ul>
<li>CryptPad is <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/glossary/open-source-software">open source</a>
software and as such there are <a href="https://cryptpad.org/instances/">various
instances</a> running it. While we host the
<a href="https://cryptpad.fr">flagship instance</a> you might choose a different one
depending on the jurisdiction for instance.</li>
<li>Ensure that you are connecting to the chosen CryptPad instance over
<a href="https://ssd.eff.org/module/what-should-i-know-about-encryption#transport-layer-encryption-example-https">HTTPS</a>.</li>
<li>All security mechanisms are only as strong as your password is.
If your password is easily guessable, attackers can get full access to all your
data stored on CryptPad.
We recommend you to either generate a random password using a <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/module/animated-overview-using-password-managers-stay-safe-online">password
manager</a> or to <a href="https://www.eff.org/dice">choose
multiple words</a> in case the password needs to be
memorizable.
Use this password only for CryptPad to avoid other services leaking it.</li>
<li>Log out of CryptPad after each session to require the password to
access your data on CryptPad. Otherwise, anybody with access to your device
can also access your data on CryptPad.</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/glossary/two-factor-authentication">two-factor
authentication</a> in
your account to add protection against phishing by adding a temporal factor to
your login.
<a href="/2024/01/09/tutorial-two-factor-authentication/">A user guide</a> is available
in this blog.</li>
</ul>
<h2>🧑 Contacts</h2>
<p>As we will show below, adding your peers as CryptPad contacts lets you more
easily and safely share documents.
You can moreover restrict access to a document to specific contacts and exchange
text messages with them.</p>
<p>The easiest way to add someone to your contacts is to <a href="https://docs.cryptpad.org/en/user_guide/collaboration.html#add-a-contact">share the link to your
profile</a>
over a secure communication to your peer and request to add each other as
contacts.</p>
<p>⚠️ Note that usernames are not unique on CryptPad.
Depending on context, it may be wise to verify a received contact request
through another secure channel.</p>
<h2>📄 Documents</h2>
<p>CryptPad uses symmetric encryption with a per-document secret key to make
your documents unreadable for anyone who has no access to their corresponding
keys. CryptPad also allows you to differentiate between read-only and write
accesses to a document. For that, anyone wanting to modify a document needs to
prove that they own the private signing key linked to the document. For this,
they sign their modifications and other people working on the same document can
verify that the modification was indeed done by an authorized person before
accepting the changes.</p>
<h3>♻ Sharing</h3>
<p>CryptPad keeps these technical details “under the hood” and provides a simple
interface to <a href="https://docs.cryptpad.org/en/user_guide/share_and_access.html#sharing-a-link">share
documents</a>
via links. Such a link essentially contains the symmetric key for encryption and
decryption, for verifying signatures as well as the one for issuing signatures
(in case of read/write access) in a <strong>non-revokable manner</strong>.</p>
<p>
<img alt="Share via link" style="border-radius: 10px" src="/images/docs-modal-share-link.png">
</p>
<p>⚠️ This implies that the document is only as safe as the <strong>weakest</strong>
communication channel used to send these links.</p>
<!-- maybe worth giving an example of a channel here -->
<p>If you consider a channel to be unsafe, or if it is publicly accessible, you
may want to isolate some of your documents from it. For instance, you can limit
the sending of edit links to <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> chats with
disappearing messages.</p>
<!-- I'm not sure we ever refer to the mailbox system in public documents, so maybe we can find another term to express this rather than the internal name
Fabrice: Agreed -->
<p>Another possibility to safely share the access is to <a href="https://docs.cryptpad.org/en/user_guide/share_and_access.html#sharing-with-contacts">send it over CryptPad to your
contacts</a>.
It internally uses the
<a href="https://docs.cryptpad.org/en/dev_guide/general.html#encryption">“mailbox”</a>
system for internal communications, without the CryptPad server knowing better.
This way, you do not have to use a secondary (potentially insecure) communication
channel.</p>
<p>
<img alt="Share with contacts" style="border-radius: 10px" src="/images/docs-modal-share-contacts.png">
</p>
<p>⚠️ Note that CryptPad documents contain the full edit history by design. It is
easily accessible to anyone from the <a href="https://docs.cryptpad.org/en/user_guide/apps/general.html#document-history">user
interface</a>.
If you made a manipulation error, such at past some text you didn’t want to
share, while producing the document <strong>before</strong> sharing it, we recommend that you
copy-paste the version you want to share for collaboration in a new pad before
sending it to sanitize the history (it also helps to track changes afterward).</p>
<h3>⛔ Restricting Access</h3>
<p>As CryptPad operates with static keys, granted shared accesses are not revokable.
This means that by default anyone who was granted access will forever be able to
read (and modify) a document.
To prevent this, you can shut down access to a document using the
<a href="https://docs.cryptpad.org/en/user_guide/share_and_access.html#access-list">Access
List</a>
feature.</p>
<p>
<img alt="Access List" style="border-radius: 10px" src="/images/docs-modal-access-list.png">
</p>
<p>This way, only the selected persons have access to the document, independently
of who has received the sharing link.</p>
<p>Also make sure you or your <a href="https://docs.cryptpad.org/en/user_guide/collaboration.html#teams">team</a>
is set as “owner” when you create documents.
This will give you full control including the possibility to destroy a document
if it contains sensitive information or the link escapes your control.</p>
<h3>🔒 Per-Document Passwords</h3>
<p>For additional safety, you can <a href="https://docs.cryptpad.org/en/user_guide/share_and_access.html#access-tab">protect a document with a
password</a>.
The document is then only available if you have both, the sharing link and the
password.
This is especially useful for the case where you do not have a secure
communication channel to share the link, as you can send the link and the
password over two <em>distinct</em> channels (e.g., text messaging and email).
This way, the attacker has to monitor on both channels at the same time which
makes it a lot more difficult.</p>
<!-- maybe "listen" or "monitor" would be clearer than "sniff" ? -->
<!-- agreed -->
<!-- a diagram of this might be nice... like how David's shredder-unshredder image shows things being unreadable in transit, we could show two independent but readable things being combined? -->
<p>When you share documents with your contacts directly on CryptPad, communications
are encrypted, and we assume that you want to give them access.
Therefore, the password is remembered and sent with the document when you share
it.
The recipient, or yourself, are not asked for it when opening the document.
This implicitly assumes that the security of CryptPad drive is at least as
strong as the communication channels used to share the document.</p>
<h3>💨 Self-Destruction</h3>
<p>CryptPad allows you to make <a href="https://docs.cryptpad.org/en/user_guide/security.html#self-destructing-documents">self-destructing
documents</a>
which will be destroyed either after the set expiration time or after the shared
document was opened the first time.</p>
<p>This feature is especially useful if you have to share sensitive data that
should not be accessible forever.
You could use it to share a password to a peer for example.</p>
<h2>🕵️ Anonymity</h2>
<!-- it should be noted who this is hidden from. Peers in the same document can't determine that you're using Firefox/Safari, but the server can -->
<p>CryptPad only provides a weak form of anonymity and does not hide your
<a href="https://ssd.eff.org/glossary/ip-address">IP address</a> or your <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent">“user
agent”</a>
(browser and <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/glossary/operating-system">operating system</a>).
The server can furthermore theoretically link IP addresses of people who are often collaborating on the same documents.
Of course, we do not run these analytics for our flagship instance, but we want
you to have to trust us as little as possible.
You may want therefore use the following tools and techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/">Tor browser</a> to connect to
CryptPad and hide your IP address.</li>
<li>A burner account that is only used for specific high-risk actions such as
working on a small set of documents or publishing sensitive information to
prevent the possibility of linking IP addresses of collaborating people.</li>
<li><a href="https://tails.boum.org/">Tails</a> for leaving no traces on your local device.</li>
</ul>
<h2>💡 Other Tools</h2>
<p>CryptPad is designed to be a general, easy-to-use office suite.
As such it may not always fit your specific needs.
We redirect you to other tools and services that are not affiliated to CryptPad
for the following actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/module/animated-overview-using-password-managers-stay-safe-online">password
