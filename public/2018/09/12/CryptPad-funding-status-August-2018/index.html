<p>We have now passed the summer since we have started the OpenCollective for CryptPad and started our campaign for funding CryptPad and ensuring its future in 2019, so I wanted to give an update on this funding initiative.</p>
<p>First we are highly grateful to all that have responded positively and also that have relayed our campaign. We do feel stronger with the help of our community and it motivates us more.</p>
<p>We have now received a few more contributions during this month of August, and in particular a 100 Euro donation from Matthieu Herrb. In July we had received a commitment from the <a href="https://c3w.at/">C3Wien Community</a> in Austria, to contribute 360 Euros / year as well as some of their members to whom our communication was relayed. We have also received a few donations for more than 50 Euros coming from the USA and Germany (thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/mikegoelzer">Michael Goelzer</a>, KimoNine, shibayashi) and also monthly donations (thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/dangagliar">Daniele Gagliardi</a> and an anonymous backer !) and one time donations reaching now more than <a href="https://opencollective.com/cryptpad/#contributors">10 donators through OpenCollective</a>.</p>
<p>We also had new subscribers to the CryptPad subscriptions and in total now we can count on 40 participants to CryptPad funding for a total now of 320 Euros for the month of August and 2250 Euros since subscriptions started last year. This funding originates from 11 different countries around the world.</p>
<p><img src="/images/cryptpad-countries-201808.png" alt="funding by country"></p>
<p>XWiki SAS is also matching the donations we received since the beginning of the campaign and we are now reaching a budget of 2614 Euros on OpenCollective.</p>
<p>This amount is of course still low and not enough to guarantee funding next year for CryptPad, but it's a start without much communication about the funding of CryptPad and about the long term objectives of this project. We still have 7 months to grow this funding to contribute to the development of CryptPad.</p>
<p>Now we need more help ! First we need to be able to sustain our team, but also we need to be able to expand, especially if we want to have Open Source software in the Zero-Knowledge space. Proprietary closed source software providing some way of Zero-Knowledge will probably start growing with extensive funding. If we want independent free-software alternatives for this type of software, then we need to group our effort and fund open source solutions like CryptPad.</p>
<p>Since the launch of the campaign we have also published a <a href="/tags/roadmap/">roadmap for CryptPad</a> of what we would like to achieve with the funding. It's also available on the <a href="https://opencollective.com/cryptpad/#about">OpenCollective web site</a>. Come check it out and see our ambitious objectives for this project. Aaron and Yann, our CryptPad developers, are already hard at work and the shared folders feature, one of the most demanded features, is already advancing very fast. During the summer there are has been <a href="https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/releases">3 new releases of CryptPad</a></p>
<p><a href="https://cryptpad.fr">Try CryptPad</a>, love it, <a href="https://opencollective.com/cryptpad/">take care of it</a>, and even better <a href="https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad">come help</a> !</p>
