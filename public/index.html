        <p>September is always a busy month for us as many people return from holidays to their regular schedules. Along with the changing of the physical seasons, we’re marking a number of project milestones as well.</p>
<h2 id="Dropping-support-for-Internet-Explorer"><a href="#Dropping-support-for-Internet-Explorer" class="headerlink" title="Dropping support for Internet Explorer"></a>Dropping support for Internet Explorer</h2><p>Microsoft’s Office365 platform officially stopped supporting Internet Explorer 11 in August, and we decided it was a good time to do the same. Up until our <a href="https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/releases/tag/4.11.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4.11 release</a> we were careful to maintain compatibility with this browser that had not received any new features since 2013. Moving on from IE lets us rely on modern functionality, simplifying our code and making CryptPad smaller and faster to load.</p>
<h2 id="End-of-NLnet-PET"><a href="#End-of-NLnet-PET" class="headerlink" title="End of NLnet PET"></a>End of NLnet PET</h2><p>As described in our <a href="https://social.weho.st/web/statuses/106901028968963691" target="_blank" rel="noopener">toots</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptpad/status/1435901167524007936" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweets</a> on September 9th, <em>4.11</em> also included significant improvements to our <em>Forms</em> app. With this second round of changes deployed we are nearly ready to close our <a href="https://nlnet.nl/project/CryptPadForms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">third and final NLnet PET project</a> before NLnet foundation concludes their NGI0 <em>Privacy-Enhancing Technologies</em> program.</p>
<p>NLnet’s advocacy for open-source software and direct support of its developers has had an incredible impact on our project and hundreds of others like it. If you haven’t already done so, now is a great time to skim through the list of <a href="https://nlnet.nl/project/current.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">projects they’ve funded</a> to count how many of them you personally use!</p>
<h2 id="DAPSI-Phase-2"><a href="#DAPSI-Phase-2" class="headerlink" title="DAPSI Phase 2"></a>DAPSI Phase 2</h2><p>We’re also approaching a milestone for the <a href="https://dapsi.ngi.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NGI DAPSI</a> project that we’ve been working on in parallel. We’ll present our latest research into client-side file format conversion, including some prototypes that we hope to deploy later in the year and our findings from the survey on file format conversion requirements that closed earlier this month. If all goes well we will receive a second round of funding to continue with the proposed work plan.</p>
<h2 id="A-brief-pause-in-our-regular-release-schedule"><a href="#A-brief-pause-in-our-regular-release-schedule" class="headerlink" title="A brief pause in our regular release schedule"></a>A brief pause in our regular release schedule</h2><p>The next few weeks are likely to be quite intense for us. We’ll be focused on wrapping up our current projects and preparing to launch a new round of projects for 2022. There are several very promising opportunities on our horizon and it looks like we’re going to have to hire to be able to follow through on all of our plans.</p>
<p>We’ll announce exactly what positions we’re looking to fill within our team and provide updates to our roadmap as soon as a few more details are finalized. A number of important deadlines happen to coincide in a short timespan, so we’ll take a short break from our regular release cycle and resume our usual pace later in October.</p>
<p>Until then, thanks to all our supporters!</p>

        <p>This month the team has been operating at reduced capacity as we took turns taking much needed breaks. There is less than usual to report on so this status update will be a short one. Rest assured however that lots of things are in preparation for the near future.</p>
<p>We released CryptPad version <a href="https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/releases/tag/4.10.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4.10.0</a> with some inital improvements to Forms.</p>
<h2 id="Forms-hackathon"><a href="#Forms-hackathon" class="headerlink" title="Forms hackathon"></a>Forms hackathon</h2><p>August was the time for the yearly XWiki seminar (held mostly virtually again this year). During the traditional hackathon sprint we worked on presenting Form responses in a more appealing and useful way, using basic bar charts.</p>
<p><img src="/images/forms_chart_timeline.png" alt="Experiments with Charts.css">  </p>
<p>We experimented with <a href="https://chartscss.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Charts.css</a> at first, and were impressed. In the end there were too many tweaks necessary to make it work with CryptPad styles, so we ended up re-implementing our own minimal table-based bar charts. These are now used on the response page to show a timeline of responses and visualise question results.</p>
<p><img src="/images/forms_graphs.png" alt="The new graphs on the Form response page"></p>
<p>We will re-use these charts where relevant on the rest of the platform. For example the admin panel now <a href="https://pixelfed.social/p/cryptpad_design/334240738311278592" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shows a graph of instance performance</a>.</p>
<p>There is a lot more coming to Forms. We are currently working on a host of new features and improvements to address issues and requests raised during our research over the summer. All of this will be covered in next month’s post (hopefully), for now I will leave you with this teaser: </p>

<h2 id="cryptpad-design-on-Pixelfed"><a href="#cryptpad-design-on-Pixelfed" class="headerlink" title="@cryptpad_design on Pixelfed"></a>@cryptpad_design on Pixelfed</h2><p>As you may have noticed, the image above is embedded from the <a href="https://pixelfed.social/cryptpad_design" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@cryptpad_design</a> account on <a href="https://pixelfed.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pixelfed</a>. This is a new experiment in communicating about the design work that goes into CrytpPad. Pixelfed is part of the fediverse, so you can follow from accounts on Mastodon, Pleroma, etc (there is also an <a href="https://pixelfed.social/users/cryptpad_design.atom" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RSS feed</a>). Followers will get sneak previews of upcoming features, random screenshots, and highlights of FOSS design tools. Subscribe if that sounds interesting to you.</p>
<p>This wraps up our news for this month. The team is busy with Forms v2 and there will be lots to talk about in the near future. In the meantime, <a href="https://cryptpad.fr/form/#/2/form/view/kdhTrcywvS+ToQ3r4DI75sbfz+uyUPlHRWJhyWF7pVI/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our research survey about document import/export</a> is still open for feedback to inform our future work improving document conversions.</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>This month we released two versions of CryptPad. <a href="https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/releases/tag/4.8.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4.8.0</a> included some early work on <a href="https://dapsi.ngi.eu/meet-interoffice-and-its-cryptpad-project/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">INTEROFFICE</a> format conversions. <a href="https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/releases/tag/4.9.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4.9.0</a> addressed some early feedback on the Forms application as well as requests for a way to add links (URLs) to the Drive and to share them with contacts. </p>
<p>During both release cycles, since the launch of Forms last month, we have been conducting a lot of research. First about the use of the Forms application itself, and now also to inform work on INTEROFFICE.</p>
<h2 id="Forms-survey-and-interviews"><a href="#Forms-survey-and-interviews" class="headerlink" title="Forms survey and interviews"></a>Forms survey and interviews</h2><p><img src="/images/forms-usage-pie-chart.png" alt="The majority of more than 300 participants in our survey indicated that they use forms in a professional or research context"></p>
<p>The first thing we did after launching the new Forms application was to use it to survey people on cryptpad.fr. We asked them about their use of online forms and recruited some volunteers for one-to-one interviews. These are still ongoing. Once they are complete and analyzed, we will use all of the findings to inform the next round of developments on Forms.</p>
<p>In the meantime, <a href="https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/releases/tag/4.9.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4.9.0</a> included some minor improvements (e.g. randomizing ordered-list questions) and bug fixes based on early feedback. Unfortunately one of the bugs affected our own <a href="https://cryptpad.fr/form/#/2/form/view/kdhTrcywvS+ToQ3r4DI75sbfz+uyUPlHRWJhyWF7pVI/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey about file import/export</a> (see next section). We found that setting an expiration date far enough into the future (above 23 days) caused the Submit button to disappear. So if you filled it out and weren’t able to submit, know that this is now fixed!</p>
<h2 id="INTEROFFICE-survey"><a href="#INTEROFFICE-survey" class="headerlink" title="INTEROFFICE survey"></a>INTEROFFICE survey</h2><p>We have started work on INTEROFFICE, our project about improving conversion between document formats in CryptPad (and in the browser in general). We already have some knowledge of requested conversions from a couple years worth of support tickets and feature requests. However after seeing the relatively high number of responses to the Forms survey (300+), we decided to conduct one for file import/export to get even more insight into what people use and request.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptpad.fr/form/#/2/form/view/kdhTrcywvS+ToQ3r4DI75sbfz+uyUPlHRWJhyWF7pVI/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">File import/export survey</a> will be open until the 8th of September. Please fill it out if you haven’t already, and now you can actually submit!</p>
<h2 id="Other-news"><a href="#Other-news" class="headerlink" title="Other news"></a>Other news</h2><p>The work on INTEROFFICE also includes a series of business mentoring sessions as part of the DAPSI project. This month we started putting some of the advice received into practice by preparing a new project website that we hope to launch this fall. This will include a list of public instances to share the load of free users with cryptpad.fr. The project site will be separate from the flagship instance and it will offer a range of services to host your own instance, from one day installation help to fully managed service.</p>
<p><img src="/images/cryptpad-in-japanese.png" alt="CryptPad&#39;s home page in Japanese"></p>
<p>🇯🇵 CryptPad is now fully translated to Japanese. Big thanks to <a href="https://mstdn.progressiv.dev/@suguru" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@suguru@mstdn.progressiv.dev</a> for all the work!</p>
<p>This wraps up our news for the month. The coming cycle will be on the quiet side as the team takes turns taking much needed breaks. </p>

        <p>This month we released two versions of CryptPad. <a href="https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/releases/tag/4.6.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4.6</a> was a stability update addressing many minor issues while the team prepared for <a href="https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/releases/tag/4.7.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4.7</a> and a major new feature: the new <em>Forms</em> application.</p>
<h2 id="Say-hello-to-Forms"><a href="#Say-hello-to-Forms" class="headerlink" title="Say hello to Forms!"></a>Say hello to Forms!</h2><p><img src="/images/form-preview.png" alt="Preview of the new Form application">  </p>
<p>The <em>Poll</em> application in CryptPad was aimed at choosing a meeting date between a group of people. However it had some major shortcomings including “all or nothing” edit rights where participants could modify other people’s answers. Part of our <a href="https://nlnet.nl/project/CryptPadForms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dialogue</a> project proposal was to address these issues in a complete re-write of the application. Another aspect of the project aims to provide a new application for online surveys beyond simple polls.   </p>
<p>The new <em>Form</em> application is an answer to both of these proposals. Polls are now one of 8 question types that can be added to an online form. Earlier in the project we <a href="https://blog.cryptpad.fr/2021/04/26/status-april-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spun out the reminders API element of forms into a full blown calendar app</a>. With <em>Forms</em> we are merging a variety of use cases into one application. As we have <a href="https://social.weho.st/@cryptpad/106419898274848746" target="_blank" rel="noopener">indicated</a> polls created with the old application remain available, but the creation of new ones is discouraged and all our future development efforts will be directed at <em>Forms</em>.  </p>
<p>We released the first Beta version of forms with CryptPad <a href="https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/releases/tag/4.7.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4.7.0</a> (on June 16th). There are many things we still want to improve, including:   </p>
<ul>
<li>Export of responses (e.g. to .CSV)  </li>
<li>Better visualization of responses (e.g. with simple bar charts)  </li>
<li>“Required” questions that would print an error if left empty  </li>
<li>Notifications for form authors (e.g. when someone has responded)  </li>
<li>A default “poll” template to make it easy to replicate the behaviour of the deprecated <em>Poll</em> app  </li>
</ul>
<p>We are gathering feedback on these and anything else that might be improved, using the <em>Form</em> app itself for a feedback survey that is open until <strong>July 12th</strong>. Please <a href="https://cryptpad.fr/form/#/2/form/view/gYs4QS7DetInCXy0z2CQoUW6CwN6kaR2utGsftDzp58/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">let us know of any comments on the application</a> and what you would like to see improved, especially if you use online forms regularly. We really appreciate the time of nearly 100 people who have already sent in their comments. These will inform our work as we improve <em>Forms</em> this summer.  </p>
<p>Details on how to use the <em>Form</em> application are available in the <a href="https://docs.cryptpad.fr/en/user_guide/apps/form.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CryptPad User Guide</a>.  </p>
<h2 id="A-call-to-instance-administrators"><a href="#A-call-to-instance-administrators" class="headerlink" title="A call to instance administrators"></a>A call to instance administrators</h2><p>This month we sent out our first—and last—mass email to CryptPad instance administrators. This was a strange feeling for a team that spends most of its time working on ways to <strong>not</strong> know anything about its users. However we felt that version 4.7.0 was a good time to remind all admins to upgrade to latest version, and to ask for their consent for future communications as this is now managed directly from the admin panel.  </p>
<p>First of all, how did we have their email? The configuration for a new instance includes providing an email contact for the administrator, and this is sent to the development team in the daily “ping” that lets us know how many declared CryptPad instances are active. This is all detailed in the configuration file that admins read when setting up their instance.  </p>
<p>In both releases this month we have made improvements to the administration panel of CryptPad instances. More settings, such as the setup for the Support ticket mailbox, are now available from the panel rather than buried in configuration files. This also includes new settings for administrators to manage how they communicate (or not) with the development team.   </p>
<p>The “mass email” was to encourage all administrators to upgrade to the latest 4.7.0 version in order to 1) benefit from all of the new features and security improvements made to CryptPad in the last few months (or years depending on the version they were on) and 2) manage further communication with the development team going forward. These communications will include security notifications and other things such as inclusion in a directory of open instances that we are working on setting up.   </p>
<hr>
<p>There is one last bit of news to wrap up: CryptPad is now included in <a href="https://catalogue.numerique.gouv.fr/solutions/cryptpad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Catalogue GouvTech, a software directory curated by the French state</a>  </p>
<p>The next month will be spent improving <em>Forms</em> and starting work on our <a href="https://blog.cryptpad.fr/2021/04/26/status-april-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">INTEROFFICE project</a> for <a href="https://dapsi.ngi.eu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DAPSI</a>, working towards improved import/export and document conversions from within CryptPad.  </p>
